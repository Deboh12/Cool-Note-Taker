## Description

The Note Taker application was developed with the primary motivation of providing a simple and intuitive platform for users, particularly small business owners, to write, save, and organize notes. This application addresses the need for a straightforward and accessible tool to keep track of tasks and ideas. Through the development process, I learned about the intricacies of setting up a full-stack application, including front-end JavaScript, Express.js back-end, and handling JSON data.

## Features

1. Express.js Backend: Utilizes Express.js, a flexible Node.js web application framework, to handle server-side operations. This includes setting up API routes for handling note data, serving static files, and managing server requests and responses.

2. Persistent Storage: Notes are saved in a JSON file on the server side, ensuring data is stored persistently across sessions.

3. Learning in Action: This project demonstrates the practical application of Express.js in creating a functional full-stack web application.
